# === Input & Scene ===
face_path: <project_root>/data/scenes/face/meshes/cartoon_clean.obj
mesh_name: 'mesh' # Optional - used for naming shapekeys in Blender
mesh_scale_factor: 0.7

# === Text Prompts ===
prompt: 3D model photorealistic portrait of cute green goblin
negative_prompt: deformed, distorted, misshapen, Sloth goonie, asymmetrical, broken geometry, unnatural proportions, 
                unrealistic anatomy, mutated, lumpy, melted face, warped mesh, glitch, 
                disfigured, extra limbs, twisted features

# === Optimization ===
num_of_iterations: 6001
reinit_opt_every: 300          # optional; set if intermediate saves desired
step_size: 0.0001

# === Regularization & Smoothness ===
lambda_reg: 10                  # Sobolev smoothness weight (heat-equation-based regularization)
lambda_sym: 30                  # Symmetry loss weight
a_willmore: 0.0                 # Willmore energy weight (for curvature regularization, optional)
laplacian_type: cot             # Laplacian discretization type: "cot", "uniform" or "robust"

# === Multi-Resolution Control ===
decimate_ratio: 0.7
res_level: 1                    # 1 is enough when optimizing only low-res; code can be adapted for multi-res

# === Deformation Constraints ===
deform_length_t_ratio_h: 0.002  # Max deformation length ratio for stability

# === Debug & Development ===
debug_mode: false
